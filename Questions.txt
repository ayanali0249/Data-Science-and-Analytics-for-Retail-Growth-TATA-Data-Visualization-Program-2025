# Business Questions for Analysis

## Question 1
The CEO of the retail store is interested in viewing the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view
granular data by analyzing revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in seasonal trends and wants to explore why these trends occur.
This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

## Question 2
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries that are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in
viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to include the United Kingdom in this visual.

## Question 3
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows
the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to
target the higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

## Question 4
The CEO is looking to gain insights into the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the
greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions with high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy to
target these areas and generate more business. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without needing to scroll or hover over the
data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom, as the CEO is more interested in viewing the
countries with expansion opportunities.
